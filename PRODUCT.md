## Users

Developers who use the Pi coding agent with multiple model providers and want predictable control over which model handles each prompt. They need to understand the routing decision quickly, verify it before sending, and retain manual control when automation is not appropriate.

## Product Purpose

Pi-Bifrost is a model-routing extension for Pi. It classifies the current prompt into a configured tier, selects a candidate using cost, context-window, list-order, or random strategies, and switches Pi to that model before the prompt is sent. Success means users can reduce repetitive model switching without losing visibility, privacy choices, or overrides.

## Brand Personality

Lean, precise, and candid. The voice is technical and confident without exaggerated performance, cost, or reliability claims.

## Product Philosophy

Follow [`docs/product-philosophy.md`](docs/product-philosophy.md). Bifrost evolves from explicit configuration through observable, advisory, opt-in, and only then bounded automation. Every routing signal must remain inspectable, overridable, and testable.

## Anti-references

Generic SaaS templates, decorative control-console layouts, oversized type, unsupported metrics, vague AI claims, equal-card marketing grids, and any treatment heavier than the extension itself. The page should feel related to pi.dev without copying its identity.

## Design Principles

1. Show the routing decision before explaining it.
2. Make automation inspectable and overridable.
3. Separate metadata-only routing from optional model-based classification.
4. Present configuration as working source-backed examples, not marketing decoration.
5. Stay visually close to Pi's lean, content-first character and keep Pi-Bifrost's styling subordinate to the product information.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Target WCAG 2.2 AA with semantic landmarks and headings, visible focus states, keyboard-operable controls, minimum 44px touch targets, reduced-motion support, readable code blocks, sufficient contrast, and a layout that works without horizontal page scrolling at 320px.
